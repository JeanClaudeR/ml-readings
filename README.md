# ml-readings
A list of papers / videos / tutorials / blog posts on machine learning.

The following notebooks can be viewed through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) for proper rendering of formulas:

1. [Stochastic Variational Inference and Variational Autoencoders](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/debasishg/ml-readings/blob/master/StochasticVIAndVAE.ipynb?flush_cache=true) - This notebook contains details of how we can evolve into the architecture of a VAE starting from a simple problem of fitting a dataset of natural images into a probabilistic distribution.
2. [Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/debasishg/ml-readings/blob/master/MLE.ipynb?flush_cache=true) - This notebook contains some useful derivations for MLE.
3. [Deep Generative Modeling - a consolidated overview](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/debasishg/ml-readings/blob/master/Generative.ipynb) - This notebook contains a consolidated overview of the various types of deep generative models with a comprehensive set of references for each of them.
